In lemmatization, we try to reduce a given word to its root word. The root word is called a lemma in the lemmatization process. Lemmatization algorithm would know that the word better is derived from the word good, and hence, the lemme is good."

    "Ans :-Chunking is used to get the required phrases from a given sentence. However, POS tagging can be used only to spot the parts of speech that every word of the sentence belongs to. When we have loads of descriptions or modifications around a particular word or the phrase of our interest, we use chunking to grab the required phrase alone, ignoring the rest around it. Hence, chunking paves a way to group the required phrases and exclude all the modifiers around them which are not necessary for our analysis. Summing up, chunking helps us extract the important words alone from lengthy descriptions. Thus, chunking is a step in information extraction. Interestingly, this process of chunking in NLP is extended to various other applications; for instance, to group fruits of a specific category, say, fruits rich in proteins as a group, fruits rich in vitamins as another group, and so on. Besides, chunking can also be used to group similar cars, say, cars supporting auto-gear into one group and the others which support manual gear into another chunk and so on."
